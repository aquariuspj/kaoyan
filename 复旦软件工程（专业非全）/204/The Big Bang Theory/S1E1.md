### Section 1:  

**【原文】**  
**Sheldon:** So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit observed, it will not go through both slits. If it's unobserved, it will. However, if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target, it won't have gone through both slits.  
**Leonard:** Agreed. What's your point?  
**Sheldon:** There's not point, I just think it's a good idea for a t-shirt.  
**Leonard:** Excuse me.
**Docter:** Hang on.
**Leonard:** One across is "aegean", eight down is "nabokov", twenty six across is "MCM", fourteen down is ... move your finger ... "phylum" which makes fourteen across "port-au-prince". See Papa Doc's capitol idea, that's "port-au-prince". Haiti.  
**Docter:** Can I help you?
**Leonard:** Yes. Is this the high-iq sperm bank?
**Docter:** If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.  
**Sheldon:** I think this is the place.  
**Docter:** Fill these out.  
**Leonard:** Thank you, we'll be right back.  
**Docter:** Oh, take your time, I'll just finish my crossword puzzle ... Oh wait ...  
**Sheldon:** Leonard, I don't think I can do this.  
**Leonard:** What are you kidding? you're a semi-pro.  
**Sheldon:** No. We are committing genetic fraud. There's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring. Think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at fuddruckers.  
**Leonard:** Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.  
**Sheldon:** I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads. But there's some poor wuman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm. What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?  
**Leonard:** I'm sure she'll still love him.  
**Sheldon:** I wouldn't.  
**Leonard:** Well, what do you want to do?  
**Sheldon:** I want to leave.  
**Leonard:** Ok.  
**Sheldon:** What's the protocol for leaving?  
**Leonard:** I don't know. I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.  
**Sheldon:** Let's try just walking out.  
**Leonard:** Ok...  
**Docter:** Bye.  
**Sheldon:** Bye...  
**Leonard:** Bye, Nice meeting you.
